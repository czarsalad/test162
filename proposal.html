		<h1>Final Web Site Project Proposal</h1>
		<ol>
			<li> My ideal website will be used as a portfolio for work that I have created as well as technical skills I've acquired, possibly image based tutorials on how to use some obscure programs.</li>

			<li> Any prospective employer or someone looking for a use of a specific skill.</li>

			<li> I want them to poke around my site and see everything that I can do, or to find help with uncommon programs. I've made a few websites using jekyll so I've gotten used to making simple and to the point sites.</li>

			<li> All the content I plan on putting on my site will be my own, either examples of previous projects or images/screenshots I've taken myself. I've still got a lot left over from a website I used to have so I'd like to reincorporate those.</li>

			<li> I selected this subject because it provides me with a creative outlet, in the form of image based tutorials, as well as showcasing my work to people who I may want to get a job from in the future.</li>
