		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<ol>
			<li> My name is Ethan Campbell and I like messing around with technology and cars.</li>

			<li> I'm taking this mostly for personal interests, but also because it's a skill that I'd like to have so I could use it in a professional setting as well.</li>

			<li> I'm currently taking a Photoshop course, MULTI121, and another course that got the start date pushed back with a name I can't remember.</li>

			<li> I like to build computers and I like to work on my Cherokee, picking which one is better really just depends on the day. They both provide me with endless amounts of fun because there's always something that can be worked on or improved.</li>
